# Blog Site Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Web Programming course, aimed at implementing a full-fledged blog site. The blog site is built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, incorporating features like displaying posts, commenting, liking, user registration and login, editing and deleting posts or comments, search functionality, and a feedback form among others.
